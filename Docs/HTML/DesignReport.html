<p>We are developing a TicTacToe game with Node, Circle CI and Heroku. A few rules will be set which will be important for the development process to keep consistency throughout the code.</p>

<hr>
<p>In this project we learned to set up technical infrastructure to support agile development by implementing the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players alternately put Xs and Os in compartments of a figure in a 3x3 grid and each tries to get a row of three Xs or three Os before the opponent does.  We will use Javascript to code the game and complete it with Test Driven Development.</p>

<hr>
<p>The first thing we did was setting up a diagram for a better vision of what functions and activity(action?) we plan to have in our code.</p>
