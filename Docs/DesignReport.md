# DesignReport

## Introduction
---
We are developing a TicTacToe game with Node, Circle CI and Heroku. A few rules will be set which will be important for the development process to keep consistency throughout the code.

## Description
---
In this project we learned to set up technical infrastructure to support agile development by implementing the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players alternately put Xs and Os in compartments of a figure in a 3x3 grid and each tries to get a row of three Xs or three Os before the opponent does.  We will use Javascript to code the game and complete it with Test Driven Development.

## Diagram
---
The first thing we did was setting up a diagram for a better vision of what functions and activity we plan to have in our code.



## Rules
---
### JavaScript
1. All classes and variables should use camelCase
2. All curly brackets start in the same line as the class, function or a loop declaration
3. Separate operators from variables with space
4. All work on the code is done on a branch
5. All commits should have a descriptive comment

### HTML
1. All elements in lower case
2. All css and script is stored in a separate file
3. Equals symbol in references are not separated by a space
